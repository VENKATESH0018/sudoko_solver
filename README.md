Sudoku Solver
A Java-based implementation of a Sudoku Solver that efficiently finds solutions to a given Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. This project demonstrates concepts of recursion, constraint satisfaction, and problem-solving techniques in programming.

Features
Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.
Implements backtracking to try possible solutions and validate them.
Includes validation to ensure safe placement of numbers in rows, columns, and sub-grids.
Outputs all possible solutions for a given puzzle.
Provides a clean and modular structure for easy understanding and enhancement.
Algorithm Overview
Backtracking:

Attempts to fill each cell recursively with numbers from 1 to 9.
Validates each placement against the Sudoku rules (rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids).
Backtracks when a placement leads to a conflict.
Validation:

Ensures each number appears only once in a row, column, and respective sub-grid.
How It Works
The input puzzle is defined as a 9x9 grid, where:

0 represents an empty cell to be solved.
Other numbers (1-9) are pre-filled values.
The program starts solving the puzzle from the top-left corner and recursively moves to the next cells.

Once a solution is found, it is displayed on the console.

If no solution exists, the program will inform the user.

Input Example
The program solves the following Sudoku puzzle by default:

3 0 6 5 0 8 4 0 0  
5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
0 8 7 0 0 0 0 3 1  
0 0 3 0 1 0 0 8 0  
9 0 0 8 6 3 0 0 5  
0 5 0 0 9 0 6 0 0  
1 3 0 0 0 0 2 5 0  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 4  
0 0 5 2 0 6 3 0 0  
Output Example
A possible solution is displayed as:

3 1 6 5 7 8 4 9 2  
5 2 9 1 3 4 7 6 8  
4 8 7 6 2 9 5 3 1  
2 6 3 4 1 5 9 8 7  
9 7 4 8 6 3 1 2 5  
8 5 1 7 9 2 6 4 3  
1 3 8 9 4 7 2 5 6  
6 9 2 3 5 1 8 7 4  
7 4 5 2 8 6 3 1 9
